## Description
Lets registered nurturia users download their own content, or the content of their friends who have set their feed as "open to friends" (posts, comments, photos).

Reload the Google sheets. Choose any menu function from the "Nurti menu", authorize the Apps Script. Select "Kullanici ata" to enter your username and password. This app saves your username and password in the hidden Settings sheet of this Google Sheet. No data is transmitted outside of this sheet except to log in to the Nurturia website.
